## üéØ Goal
The Slingshot VoIP team will receive a modular batch application that extracts, transcodes, and transforms the properties of audio files, transcribes audio to text, and stores the final conversion into a relational database.

---

## üìú Main Use Case
-   Transcribe voicemails into text.

---

## ü¶Ñ Features
-   Application can be fed a single or a directory of audios 
-   Ability to use different languages with Google APIs - default is English

## üèÉRunning the Solution (select an option)
1. Using Docker
2. Starting a new server of an AMI (Amazon Web Services Image)
3. Building from source
--- 

## Option 1 ‚Äì üê≥ Docker 
> Setup time 15 min

The application can easily be installed and deployed in a Docker container.

The application can be deployed in a local machine or directly into a Linux server. (Please refer to the Docker setup video outlined in Demo Videos for guidance.) By default, the Docker will expose ports 80, 8080, 3306 - this can be changed within the .env if necessary. When ready, simply use Docker compose to build the image.

Images used (docker hub):

-   [PHP:7.4-apache](https://hub.docker.com/_/php)
-   [MYSQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql)
-   [PhpMyAdmin](https://hub.docker.com/_/phpmyadmin)

Step 1: Follow the Steps Outlined in Prerequisites 

Step 2:  Update Configurations (.env File)

-   ‚úÖ [Clone Code](https://github.com/lcubestudios/slignshot-api.git) 
-   ‚úÖ Database Credentials
-   ‚úÖ Database Ports
-   ‚úÖ PhpMyAdmin Ports
-   ‚úÖ Google Key
-   ‚úÖ Drop the key file into the application directory

 
Step 3: Start Docker

-   ‚úÖ Run the Docker-compose file 
```sh
docker compose up -d ‚Äìbuild
```

This will create the Slingshot image and pull in the necessary dependencies.

-   ‚úÖ Verify containers are running 

```sh
docker ps -a
```

 
Step 4: Test the Endpoints

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser

-   ‚úÖ Update {{server}} variable in the collection to your server address
-   ‚úÖ GET, PUT, POST, DELETE  

Step 5: Terminate Docker Container

Inside the terminal run. 

```sh
docker compose down 
```

Troubleshooting:

-   Make sure there are no other containers using the same server ports. (Stop running any existing container or change the default application port (.env file).)
-   Delete any old version of the image & volume.
-   Check your internet connection.

## Option 2 ‚Äì AMI (Amazon Web Services)
> Setup time 15 - 20 min

Please refer to the AMI setup video outlined in Demo Videos for guidance. By default, the Docker will expose ports 80, 8080, 3306 - this can be changed within the .env if necessary. When ready, simply use Docker compose to build the image.

Step 1:

- ‚úÖ Search & Run AMI (ami-0dd0e30901f7aaf62)

Step 2: Update Configurations 

-   ‚úÖ Database Credentials
-   ‚úÖ Database Ports
-   ‚úÖ PhpMyAdmin Ports
-   ‚úÖ Google Key

Step 3: Start Docker

-   ‚úÖ Run the Docker-compose file 

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

-   ‚úÖ Verify containers are running 

```sh
docker ps -a
```

Step 4: Test the Endpoints

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

-   ‚úÖ Update {{server}} variable in the collection to your Server address
-   ‚úÖ GET, PUT, POST, DELETE  

Step 5: Terminate Docker Container

Inside the terminal run. 

```sh
docker-compose down 
```

## Option 3 - Building from source
> Setup time 15 min

#### Bitbucket/GitHub
Step 1: Follow the Steps Outlined in Prerequisites

Step 2: Install Server Requirements

-   ‚úÖ python3
-   ‚úÖ pip3
-   ‚úÖ PHP 7.4
-   ‚úÖ Bash
-   ‚úÖ apache2
-   ‚úÖ ffmpeg

Step 3: Install the Dependencies 

-   ‚úÖ [Clone Code](https://github.com/lcubestudios/slignshot-api.git) 
-   ‚úÖ Change Git branch to dev
```sh

ALTER TABLE `ast_voicemessages` ADD `audioname` VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL AFTER `flag`, ADD `lastmodify` TIMESTAMP(6) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6) AFTER `audioname`;
```

Step 6: Test the Endpoints

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

-   ‚úÖ Update {{server}} variable in the collection to your Server address
-   ‚úÖ GET, PUT, POST, DELETE

## How to use the solution

(Endpoint documentation also available inside Postman Collection.)

#### GET (Load Single Audio Values) 
- Endpoint: localhost/trigger.php/?id=1234567890
- Query Params: id=number
- You can send the ID in the URL
- No JSON data is needed

#### POST (Transcribe audio(s) from a folder)
- Endpoint: localhost/trigger.php
- Transcribes audio to text from a directory. No parameters are needed.
- The directory path needs to be specified at the .env level.

#### PUT (Transcribe Existing Audio)
- Endpoint: localhost/trigger.php/
- Send ID as JSON
- Ex: { "id": 1234567890}

#### PUT (Transcribe All existing Audios)
- Endpoint: localhost/trigger.php
- Transcribes all voicemails where text_adudio is NULL.
- No ID or JSON data is needed

#### DELETE (Delete a Record)
- Delete a record from the database.
- JSON data is expected.
- Ex: {"id": 1642295310}
